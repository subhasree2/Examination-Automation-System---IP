              <h3>Internet Programming</h3> 
              <p>An Internet application is a client/server application that uses standard Internet protocols for connecting the client to the server. You can use exactly the same techniques to create a true Internet application, which is available publicly through the World Wide Web, or to create an intranet application. An intranet application is one that runs on your corporate intranet, and is only available to the staff in your corporation. Whenever we talk about Internet applications, we mean either true Internet applications or intranet applications. For an introduction to the World Wide Web, see the appendix Introduction to the World Wide Web.
              
              Internet applications are thin-client, thick-server. This means that the client end, the part the end-user sees and interacts with, is only responsible for the user interface. The client runs on a Web browser - the standard tool for accessing the Internet. All the processing is done at the server end - where your corporate data is.
              
              Because your applications use standard Internet protocols for client/server communications, you can make your applications cross-platform. The server-side programs are written in Micro Focus COBOL, and so you can run them on Windows NT or UNIX servers (you need to purchase Micro Focus COBOL for UNIX to run applications on UNIX).
              
              The server-side program for an Internet application communicates with the client through the Web server software for the machine. <p>
              
              <h3>Operating System</h3>
              An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
              
              Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.
              
              For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer â€“ from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.</p>
              
              <h3>Computer Architecture</h3>
              <p>Computer architectures represent the means of interconnectivity for a computer's hardware components as well as the mode of data transfer and processing exhibited. Different computer architecture configurations have been developed to speed up the movement of data, allowing for increased data processing. The basic architecture has the CPU at the core with a main memory and input/output system on either side of the CPU (see Figure 1.7). A second computer configuration is the central input/output controller (see Figure 1.8). A third computer architecture uses the main memory as the location in the computer system from which all data and instructions flow in and out. A fourth computer architecture uses a common data and control bus to interconnect all devices making up a computer system (see Figure 1.9). An improvement on the single shared central bus architecture is the dual bus architecture. This architecture either separates data and control over the two buses or shares them to increase overall performance .</p> 
              
              <h3>Probability and Statistics</h3>
              <p>Probability means possibility. It is a branch of mathematics that deals with the occurrence of a random event. The value is expressed from zero to one. Probability has been introduced in Maths to predict how likely events are to happen. The meaning of probability is basically the extent to which something is likely to happen. This is the basic probability theory, which is also used in the probability distribution, where you will learn the possibility of outcomes for a random experiment. To find the probability of a single event to occur, first, we should know the total number of possible outcomes.</p>
              
              <h3>Microprocessors and Interfacing</h3>
              <p>When we are executing any instruction, we need the microprocessor to access the memory for reading instruction codes and the data stored in the memory. For this, both the memory and the microprocessor requires some signals to read from and write to registers.
              
              The interfacing process includes some key factors to match with the memory requirements and microprocessor signals. The interfacing circuit therefore should be designed in such a way that it matches the memory signal requirements with the signals of the microprocessor.
              There are various communication devices like the keyboard, mouse, printer, etc. So, we need to interface the keyboard and other devices with the microprocessor by using latches and buffers. This type of interfacing is known as I/O interfacing.</p>
              
              <h3>Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h3>
              <p>In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing. By making use of artificial intelligence, algorithms can perform automated deductions (referred to as automated reasoning) and use mathematical and logical tests to divert the code through various routes (referred to as automated decision-making). Using human characteristics as descriptors of machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by Alan Turing with terms such as "memory", "search" and "stimulus".
              
              In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results, especially in problem domains where there is no well-defined correct or optimal result.</p>
